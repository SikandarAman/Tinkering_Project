-Created OLED.h to print values from MAX30100 sensor directly to the screen
-Usable methods from the OLED.h file:

setup() : Initializes the OLED screen and draws the static UI layout (labels, dividers, etc.)
update(int bpm, int spo2): Updates both the numeric display of heart rate and SpO2, and updates the scrolling graph with a simulated BPM value

- Changed the main file to show an example on how the OLED.h methods can be used
